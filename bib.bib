  abstract =  {If you want to program a parallel computer, a purely
                  functional language like Haskell is a promising
                  starting point. Since the language is pure, it is
                  by-default safe for parallel evaluation, whereas
                  imperative languages are by-default unsafe. But that
                  doesn't make it easy! Indeed it has proved quite
                  difficult to get robust, scalable performance
                  increases through parallel functional programming,
                  especially as the number of processors increases. A
                  particularly promising and well-studied approach to
                  employing large numbers of processors is data
                  parallelism. Blelloch's pioneering work on NESL
                  showed that it was possible to combine a rather
                  flexible programming model (nested data parallelism)
                  with a fast, scalable execution model (flat data
                  parallelism). In this paper we describe Data
                  Parallel Haskell, which embodies nested data
                  parallelism in a modern, general-purpose language,
                  implemented in a state-of-the-art compiler, GHC. We
                  focus particularly on the vectorisation
                  transformation, which transforms nested to flat data
                  parallelism.},
  read =      {yes},
  notes =     {A good paper, sadly no results section on the
                  performance of this implementation.

               It makes some
                  interesting points about locality of reference,
                  especially when an algorithm can be parallelised in
                  multiple ways.

               The code transformations are quite
                  in depth and in some cases difficult to follow.  The
                  representation of data parallel arrays with regard
                  to locality of reference and memory bandwith is
                  excelent.  This un-parametric type transformation
                  may be useful in Mercury.  When tuples are stored in
                  an array the use of multiple arrays is interesting
                  and gives some nice speed improvments for zip/unzip.

               Some interesting discussion about inlineing, map/map
                  transformations and join (split ..) transformations
                  towards the end.  These impact on how work is balanced
                  between threads.}

  abstract = {We define a practical algorithm for distributed rational tree unification and prove its correctness in both the off-line and on-line
 cases.  We derive the distributed algorithm from a centralized one,
 showing clearly the trade-offs between local and distributed
 execution.  The algorithm is used to realize logic variables in the
 Mozart Programming System, which implements the Oz language
 (see http://www.mozart-oz.org/).
 Oz appears to the programmer as
 a concurrent object-oriented language with dataflow synchronization.
 Logic variables implement the dataflow behavior.  We
 show that logic variables can easily be added to the more restricted
 models of Java and ML, thus providing an alternative way to do
 concurrent programming in these languages.  We present common
 distributed programming idioms in a network-transparent way using
 logic variables.  We show that in common cases the algorithm maintains
 the same message latency as explicit message passing.  In addition, it
 is able to handle uncommon cases that arise from the properties of
 latency tolerance and third-party independence.  This is evidence that
 using logic variables in distributed computing is beneficial at both
 the system and language levels.  At the system level, they improve
 latency tolerance and third-party independence.  At the language
 level, they help make network-transparent distribution practical.},
