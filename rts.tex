Before beginning sagnificant amounts of work on automatic parallelism we
choose to improve the performance of manual parallelisation.
Any improvment to the runtime system for manual parallelisation would have
benifits for automatic parallelism.
In Mercury, parallelisation can be introduced with the parallel conjunction
operator (\code{\&}).
A programmer can replace a sequential conjunction with a parallel one,
declaring to the compiler that the conjuncts should be executed in parallel.
However doing so did not speed up Mercury programs as expected.
In this chapter we will discuss
some of the problems affectiong performance and
many of the improvments that have made parallel execution faster.

\section{Spark queueing}

Sparks are managed in two different data structures.
The first data structure is a global queue,
since it is global it must be protected with a mutex.
It is used in a first-in-first-out manner.
The second is a context-local stack,
The stack datastructure used is described by \citet{workstealing_queue},
this was choosen as it could support work stealing.
The top of the stack is sometimes referred to as the \emph{hot end},
since it is used frequently.
Likewise, the bottom of the stack is sometimes called the
\emph{cold end}, since it is only used to implement work stealing.
The top of the stack, or hot end, can be used without locking or atomic
operations.
This is desirable, since it makes common operations inexpensive.
The local context uses the top of the stack only,
therefore sparks placed on this stack are scheduled in a
last-in-first-out manner.

When a spark is spawned off by a parallel conjunction
it is added to a global spark queue provided that there is not too much
globaly-available parallel work.
This is true if:
an engine is idle and,
the number of contexts in use plus the number of sparks in the global queue
does not exceed the maximum number of contexts permitted.
If these tests fail then the spark will be placed on the local context's
spark stack,
which is done safely without locking.
This is an optimisation,
in the common case that there is already enough parallel work,
a spark can be scheduled without contending for a lock which could slow the
system down.
The limit of contexts in use plus the number of sparks in the global queue
represents how many contexts would be in use of all the sparks in the global
queue where converted to contexts.
This limit places an upper bound on the number of contexts that may be
allocated,
which limits the amount of memory that can be allocated as stack space for
contexts
(recall that each context contains space for stacks).

\begin{algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Procedure{join\_and\_continue}{$ST, ContLabel$}
  \State aquire\_lock($ST.lock$)
  \State $ST.num\_outstanding \gets ST.num\_outstanding - 1$
  \If{$ST.num\_outstanding = 0$}
    \If{$ST.parent = this_context$}
      \State release\_lock($ST.lock$)
      \Goto{$ContLabel$}
    \Else
      \State schedule($ST.parent$)
      \State release\_lock($ST.lock$)
      \Goto{get\_global\_work}
    \EndIf
  \Else
    \State $spark \gets$ pop\_compatible\_spark
    \If{$spark$}
       \State release\_lock($ST.lock$)
       \Goto{$spark.code\_label$}
    \Else
      \If{$ST.parent = this\_context$}
         \State suspend($this\_context$)
         \State $this\_context \gets$ NULL
      \EndIf
      \State release\_lock($ST.lock$)
      \Goto{get\_global\_work}
    \EndIf
  \EndIf
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\caption{join\_and\_continue}
\label{alg:join_and_continue_peterw}
\end{algorithm}

As an engine finishes executing a parallel conjunct,
it will execute the the barrier at the end of the conjunct,
named \joinandcontinue and shown in 
Algorithm \ref{alg:join_and_continue_peterw}.
If it is known that the parallel conjunction has only been executed by
one context,
then it is safe to use a version of the barrier code that does not use
locking,
this optimisation is not shown as it is equivilent and not relevent to
our discussion,
it is described only for completeness.

The algorithm begins by checking if there are any outstanding conjuncts in
the parallel conjunction.
If there are none and the current context is the parent
context,
then execution jumps to the label after the parallel conjunction.
If the current context is not the parent context then
we can infer that the parent context is suspended,
therefore, 
the engine will schedule the parent context, before looking for global work.
It looks for global work because its local work queue is gaurenteed to be
empty since this conjunction and any nested conjunctions are complete.
Alternativly, if there are outstanding conjuncts then
the local spark stack is checked for compatible work ---
a spark whose parent context is the same as the current syncterm's parent
context.
If a compatible spark is at the top of the spark stack then it is removed
and executed.
Otherwise,
if this context is the parent context it must be suspended
before the engine looks for global work.

An engine looks for global work first by checking the global context run queue.
If it finds a runnable context and is still holding a context from a
previous execution, it saves the old context onto the free context list.
If there are no runnable contexts,
it will take a spark from the global spark queue,
and either use its current context to execute the spark,
or allocate a new context (from the free context list if possible).
If it is unsuccessful at finding work,
it will go to sleep using a pthread condition variable and the global run
queue's lock.
This condition is used to wake engines when either contexts are added to the
run queue,
or soarks are added to the spark run queue.

\section{Right vs.\ left recursion}

\end{center}
\caption{Right and left recursive map/3}
\label{fig:map_right_and_left_recursive}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:map_right_and_left_recursion} shows two alternative, parallel
implementations of \code{map/3}.
While their declarative semantics are identical,
their operational semantics are very different.  In Section
\ref{sec:backgnd_merpar} we explained that parallel conjunctions are
implemented by spawning off the tail of the conjunction and executing the
head directly.
This means that in the right recursive case (Figure
\ref{fig:map_right_recursive}), the recursive call is spawned off as a
spark,
and that in the left recursive case (Figure \ref{fig:map_left_recursion},
the recursive call is executed directly, and the loops \emph{body} is
spawned off.
These two alternatives perform very differently.

\paul{Include figures of current performance and then discuss the
problem.}


\section{Premature scheduling decisions}

Parallel conjunctions are evaluated as described in Section
\ref{sec:backgnd_merpar}.
Sparks are added to the global spark queue if the global queue has room,
otherwise they are pushed onto a context-local spark stack.
Creating a lot of parallel work and using a single global work queue can be
pesimistic,
the queue itself can become a bottleneck:
when many processors try to access it the same location in memory there will
be many cache misses and delays.
This is why \citet{wang_hons_thesis} choose to introduce local queues,
and place work on them when there is a surplus of work on the global queue.

When a engine finishes executing a context and reaches the barrier at the
end of a parallel conjunct,
it will check the context's local spark stack for any other work and attempt
to execute it.
Otherwise, it will either save the context to resume later or release the
context before checking the global spark queue and global context queue.

\section{Spare text}

\status{This text will be moved up into one of the work stealing sections
once those sections are ready}

%The spark is added to a global run queue of sparks, or if that queue is too
%full, because there's already enough parallelism,
%then the spark is added to a queue owned by the current context.
%\citet{wang_hons_thesis} intended to use the local queues for work stealing
%but had not completed his implementation,
%The work-stealing dequeue structure
%is described in \citet{Chase_2005_wsdeque}.
%see Chapter \ref{chap:rts} for details.
%
%and finds that spark is still at the head of its queue,
%it will pick it up and run it itself.
%This is a useful optimisation,
%% it is also really well-known.
%since it avoids using a separate context in the relatively common case
%that all the other CPUs are busy with their own work.
%This optimisation is also useful since it can avoid the creation of superfluous
%contexts and their stacks.
%

When an engine becomes idle, it will first try
to resume a suspended but runnable context if there is one.
If not, it will attempt to run a spark from the global spark queue.
If it successfully finds a spark, it will allocate a context,
and start running the spark in that context.

% XXX: Mention global spark queue and spark sheduling above.
% XXX:  

Barrier code is placed at the end of each conjunct,
this is named \code{join\_and\_continue} (Figure \ref{fig:par_conj}).
This code starts by atomically decrementing the number of outstanding
conjuncts in the conjunction's syncterm and checking the result for zero
(the whole operation is thread-safe, not just the decrement).
Algorithm \ref{alg:join_and_continue} shows the pesudo code for
join\_and\_continue.
