\status{This chapter is currently WIP}

Early in the project
we tested two manually parallelised programs:
a raytracer and a mandelbrot image generator.
Both of them have a single significant loop
whose iterations are independent of one another.
We expect that automatic parallelisation would parallelise this loop
as it is the best place to introduce parallelism.
When we parallelised this loop manually we did
we did not get the speedups that we expected.
Therefore,
we chose to address the performance problems
before we worked on automatic parallelism.

In this chapter we investigate and correct these performance problems.
We start with the garbage collector in Section \ref{sec:gc};
we analyse the collector's effects on performance and tune its parameters
to improve performance.
In Section \ref{sec:original_scheduling} we describe how the existing runtime
system schedules sparks.
The section provides background material for Section
\ref{sec:original_scheduling_performance}
which benchmarks the runtime system and describes two significant problems with
spark scheduling.
We address one of these problems by introducing work stealing in Section
\ref{sec:rts_work_stealing}.
Then in Section \ref{sec:rts_reorder} we reorder conjuncts in independent
parallel conjunctions to work around the other spark scheduling problem.
In Section \ref{sec:rts_work_stealing2} we make further improvments to
work stealing and change how idle engines look for work, sleep and are
woken up.
Finally, Section \ref{sec:rts_thread_pinning} describes how we pin Mercury
engines to CPU cores and SMT threads evenly.

\section{Proposed scheduling tweaks}
\label{sec:proposed_tweaks}
\status{Not written, May move to TS chapter}

I really think that this section will move to the \tscope chapter,
it will have more in common with that chapter and more data will be
available.
Secondly, \tscope can be used with micro-benchmarks to measure the
average costs of certain operations in the RTS.
I will not write it until at least the rest of this chapter is finished.

%\section{Proposed kernel support to manage processor resources}
%\label{sec:kernel_scheduling_help}
%
%\status{This may not be worth discussing until someone actually does it}
%
%Should I describe our proposal for OS kernel's to help
%applications with how many threads to use.
%GCD is related but does not fit into a language runtime system so
%easily~\cite{apple_gcd}.
%See also N:M threading.

%\section{Spare text}
%
%\status{This text will be moved up into one of the work stealing sections
%once those sections are ready}

%The spark is added to a global run queue of sparks, or if that queue is too
%full, because there's already enough parallelism,
%then the spark is added to a queue owned by the current context.
%\citet{wang:2006:thesis} intended to use the local queues for work stealing
%but had not completed his implementation,
%The work-stealing dequeue structure
%is described in \citet{Chase_2005_wsdeque}.
%see Chapter \ref{chap:rts} for details.
%
%and finds that spark is still at the head of its queue,
%it will pick it up and run it itself.
%This is a useful optimisation,
%% it is also really well-known.
%since it avoids using a separate context in the relatively common case
%that all the other CPUs are busy with their own work.
%This optimisation is also useful since it can avoid the creation of superfluous
%contexts and their stacks.
%

%When an engine becomes idle, it will first try
%to resume a suspended but runnable context if there is one.
%If not, it will attempt to run a spark from the global spark queue.
%If it successfully finds a spark, it will allocate a context,
%and start running the spark in that context.

% XXX: Mention global spark queue and spark sheduling above.
% XXX:

%Barrier code is placed at the end of each conjunct,
%this is named \code{join\_and\_continue} (Figure \ref{fig:par_conj}).
%This code starts by atomically decrementing the number of outstanding
%conjuncts in the conjunction's syncterm and checking the result for zero
%(the whole operation is thread-safe, not just the decrement).
%Algorithm \ref{alg:join_and_continue} shows the pseudo code for
%join\_and\_continue.


%XXX
%Parallel conjunctions are evaluated as described in Section
%\ref{sec:backgnd_merpar}.
%Sparks are added to the global spark queue if the global queue has room,
%otherwise they are pushed onto a context-local spark stack.
%Creating a lot of parallel work and using a single global work queue can be
%pesimistic,
%the queue itself can become a bottleneck:
%when many processors try to access it the same location in memory there will
%be many cache misses and delays.
%This is why \citet{wang:2006:thesis} choose to introduce local queues,
%and place work on them when there is a surplus of work on the global queue.
%
%When a engine finishes executing a context and reaches the barrier at the
%end of a parallel conjunct,
%it will check the context's local spark stack for any other work and attempt
%to execute it.
%Otherwise, it will either save the context to resume later or release the
%context before checking the global spark queue and global context queue.
%

%Deciding too early, results.
