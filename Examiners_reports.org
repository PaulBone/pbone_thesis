** TODO p.28 Top.  future.wait/2                              :clarification:
   When explaining the working of future.wait/2, it would be nice to
   add a line explaining why there is no danger for deadlock.

** TODO p.30-31,  Feedback                                    :clarification:
    In your argumentation for the feedback-directed approach, you state
    yourself that a program is typically executed multiple times with
    respect to different inputs (p.31). While you use this argument in
    favour of the feedback-approach (which is imo totally justified), it
    does raise the question on how well is the feedback—approach providing a
    model for all of these runs?  Unfortunately, this question is rapidly
    put aside by your remark “Most variations in input data will not effect
    parallelisation enough to cause a significant
    difference in performance” (p.31), but this is quite strong a statement;
    is there any (experimental) proof of it?  I think the chosen approach is
    a good one.  but it should be introduced/discussed within more
    appropriate level of objectiveness. See also my remark on the discussion
    w.r.t.  Static analysis (p 92).

** TODO p 34,                                                       :trivial:
    imprecise vocabulary.  On the one hand you talk about
    “computations p and C1” but further down the test they have become
    ‘“conjuncts p and q”.

   What is “HLKSlZE”?’ Is it some dark option to be set in the Eoehm
   runtime?  it, it should also be explained.  if care to mention you

** CHCK p.60. Choice of stack                                       :reorder:
   While l was wondering for several pages Why this structure had to
   be a stack, the second half of the page provides the explanation (to
   deal with nested conjunctions).  It would help the reader if this
   justification was moved to the spot. where the stacks are introduced.

    reordering independent conjunctions quite seems not far.  being pushed

   In Figure 3.6, there is an “XXX” remaining.


** TODO p.79. Busy transitions                                :clarification:
    Figure 0 = Seems strange to characterize some transitions as
    “busier” because “you think” (p.78) they occur most often.  Is
    this relevant and, if it is, could it be better (experimentally)
    validated/justified? if it isn't, don‘t talk about it as it makes
    one wonder Whether some of the made are based on
    intuitionchoicesyou only.

** TODO p.92. Static analysis                                 :clarification:
    When (re)introducing the general approach and justifying the
    feedback-approach, the discussion on profiler-feedback versus static
    analysis could be more detailed and more objective.  You put a lot of
    emphasis on “representative input” (see also my remark concerning
    pp.30-31)that is chosen by the programmer, but i why not let the user
    decide on what is “representative input” by providing, eg. a
    specification of typical input (e.g. types and size of certain
    structures). In the latter case, an approach using static analysis might
    be more useful than a profiler—based one. Just to be clear, I 0 not
    criticising your approach, nor am I asking to change it; I am only
    stating I feel it could be somewhat more objectively (with its strong
    and weak points) introduced and discussed.

    To have this 'specification of input' you need a representative
    input, so both methods have the same requirements.  Each method
    has its own strengths and may complement the other.

** TODO p.93 (end of section 4.2). Terminology                      :trivial:
   Terminology: one often uses “monovariant/polyvariant” to refer to
   the fact that a predicate/procedure is
   analysed/transformed/compiled one versus multiple times with
   respect to a somewhat different content.

** TODO p.106 (bottom of the page):                           :clarification:
   “the recursivecalls cost at its average recursion depth is used by
   the algorithm”.  is this speaking) the best one can get or would it
   be to obtain more precise results (eg.  (theoretically possible by
   performing some finpoint computation on the predicate)?

   This is what we can do without changing the profiler further.  We
   could change the profiler but we're not convinced that doing so is
   necessary.

*** TODO Scope outside of Mercury                                :discussion:
    I would have liked to see some discussion about how all the techniques
    proposed in this dissertation could be applied outside of Mercury
    [e.g., to Prolog? To functional languages?)

*** TODO Benchmark diversity                                     :discussion:
    Many of your considerations on two benchmarks, representing
    rely some fairly regular computations.  How would you consider
    these representatives?  Or, more in general, I would have liked to
    see a much broader pool of diverse benchmarks being used
    throughout the dissertation.

*** TODO Formal semantics                                        :discussion:
    There are no formal considerations about the fact that the
    parallel implementations respect the "theoretical" operational
    semantics of the language [e.g., same observable behavior).  Even
    though it is true, it would be a good idea to spell it out.

does so in a good way. The chapter could be strengthened a bit by adding

*** TODO Logic programming scope (non SLD?)                   :clarification:
    Considerations in page 9 talk about “logic programming”. but they are
    really focused on languages derived from Prolog (SLD-based, etc.).
    Logic programming is a much broader term, and the considerations in this
    page do not reach other LP languages [e.g._,ASP-based).

*** CHCK Dependent vs Independent                             :bibliographic:
    Hermenegildo used to stress that there is really no such thing as
    independent and dependent and-p, they are the same thing just seen at
    different levels of granularity [and I tend to agree with this).

    Try to find something about this in the literature, if I don't
    find anything then no action needs to be taken.

    My memory might be wrong.  but the dependent and——p model of
    Pontelli and Gupta does not really build on [45] [they are
    completely independent).  Furthermore, DDAS was the name of the
    system developed by Kish Shen, not by Pontelli Gupta.

    the last two paragraphs before 2.4.1); any evidence supporting these
