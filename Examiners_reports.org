    In your argumentation for the feedback-directed approach, you state
    yourself that a program is typically executed multiple times with
    respect to different inputs (p.31). While you use this argument in
    favour of the feedback-approach (which is imo totally justified), it
    does raise the question on how well is the feedback—approach providing a
    model for all of these runs?  Unfortunately, this question is rapidly
    put aside by your remark “Most variations in input data will not effect
    parallelisation enough to cause a significant
    difference in performance” (p.31), but this is quite strong a statement;
    is there any (experimental) proof of it?  I think the chosen approach is
    a good one.  but it should be introduced/discussed within more
    appropriate level of objectiveness. See also my remark on the discussion
    w.r.t.  Static analysis (p 92).

    This issue was discussed but the discussion could have been
    better.  The change below improves the discussion making our
    reasoning clearer.

    When (re)introducing the general approach and justifying the
    feedback-approach, the discussion on profiler-feedback versus static
    analysis could be more detailed and more objective.  You put a lot of
    emphasis on “representative input” (see also my remark concerning
    pp.30-31)that is chosen by the programmer, but i why not let the user
    decide on what is “representative input” by providing, eg. a
    specification of typical input (e.g. types and size of certain
    structures). In the latter case, an approach using static analysis might
    be more useful than a profiler—based one. Just to be clear, I 0 not
    criticising your approach, nor am I asking to change it; I am only
    stating I feel it could be somewhat more objectively (with its strong
    and weak points) introduced and discussed.

    To have this 'specification of input' you need a representative
    input, so both methods have the same requirements.  Each method
    has its own strengths and may complement the other.
