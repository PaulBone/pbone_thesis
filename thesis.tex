% WARNING: citesort, hyperref and algorithm do not play nice together.

    \item due acknowledgement has been made in the text to all other material

\chapter*{Preface}

I begun working on automatic parallelism in Mercury as part of my Honours project
for the degree of Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of Melbourne.
This work occurred before my PhD candidature commenced.
It included the profiler feedback framework that is discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:background}.
It also includes an initial, rudimentary, version of the automatic
parallelisation tool
(Section~\ref{sec:backgnd_priorautopar}
including an algorithm for determining when a sub-computation produces or
consumes a variable (Section~\ref{sec:backgnd_var_use_analysis})
and an extension to the deep profiler that enables coverage profiling
(Section~\ref{sec:backgnd_coverage}).

Peter Wang and I worked together to implement work stealing for the Mercury
runtime system.
We estimate that Peter contributed 80\% of the work stealing implementation
and that I contributed 20\%.
\paul{I haven't written up this work, I must decide which chapter it belongs
in, maybe it should be part of the background}.

Chapter~\ref{chap:overlap} is derived from a journal paper:

% XXX: not really a quote, I want this text to be typeset as a paragraph whose
% indent (not just first line) is larger than normal.

\begin{quote}
\pubauthor{Paul Bone, Zoltan Somogyi and Peter Schachte.}
\pubtitle{Estimating the overlap between dependent computations for automatic
zparallelization.}
\pubhow{Theory and Practice of Logic Programming,}{11(4--5):575--591, 2011.}
\end{quote}

% Zoltan, Peter and I worked together to develop the overlap algorithm.
% \paul{The basis for this algorithm first appears in Zoltan's Leuven slides}
% The implementation and testing is all my own work.
% Zoltan and Peter assisted me in writing and editing the paper.

Chapter~\ref{chap:loop_control} is derived from a conference paper:

\begin{quote}
\pubauthor{Paul Bone, Zoltan Somogyi and Peter Schachte.}
\pubtitle{Controlling Loops in Parallel Mercury Code.}
\pubhow{Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Declarative Aspects and
Applications of Multicore Programming,}{Philadelphia PA USA, January 2012.}
\end{quote}

% Zoltan and I developed the data structures and algorithm.
% 80\% of the implementation is my own work.
% \paul{Zoltan worked on the code generator changes, but are they actually part
% of the research?}
% Zoltan and Peter assisted me in writing and editing the paper.

Chapter~\ref{chap:tscope} is derived from a workshop paper:

\begin{quote}
\pubauthor{Paul Bone and Zoltan Somogyi.}
\pubtitle{Profiling parallel Mercury programs with \tscope.}
\pubhow{21st Workshop on Logic-based methods in Programming Environments,}
{Lexington KY USA, July 2011.}
\end{quote}

% Zoltan provided feedback about my ideas and contributed a number of ideas of
% his own.
% I am the sole author of the implementation.
% Zoltan assisted me in writing and editing the paper.

\chapter*{Contribution to published work form}

\paul{MSGR have a form we have to include here,
I think it is one form per chapter based on published work}
