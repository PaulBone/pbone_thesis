\chapter*{Preface}

I begun working on automatic parallelism in Mercury as part of my Honours project
for the degree of Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of Melbourne.
This work occured before my PhD candidature commenced.
It included the profiler feedback framework that is discussed in Section
\ref{sec:background}.
It also includes an initial version of the automatic parallelisation tool
(Section \ref{sec:background}
including two algorithms:
\paul{I don't know where I'll discuss this yet, it's currently in the overlap
paper}
the depth-first search for parallelisation opportunities
(Section \ref{sec:dfs-for-opportunities}),
and the variable use time analysis (Section \ref{sec:var_use_time})

Peter Wang and I worked together to implement work stealing for the Mercury
runtime system.
\paul{Somewhere I've written down what percentage of the work is mine, look
this up}
\paul{I haven't written up this work, I must decide which chapter it belongs
in}.

Chapter \ref{chap:overlap} is derived from a journal paper:

Paul Bone, Zoltan Somogyi and Peter Schachte.
\newblock Estimating the overlap between dependent computations for automatic
  parallelization.
\newblock {\em Theory and Practice of Logic Programming}, 11(4--5):575--591,
  2011.

Zoltan, Peter and I worked together to develop the overlap algorithm.
\paul{The basis for this algorithm first appears in Zoltan's Louven slides}
The implementation and testing is all my own work.
Zoltan and Peter assisted me in writing and editing the paper.

Chapter \ref{chap:loop_control} is derived from a conference paper:

Paul Bone, Zoltan Somogyi and Peter Schachte.
\newblock Controlling Loops in Parallel Mercury Code.
\newblock {\em Declarative Aspects of Multicore Programming},
Philadelphia PA USA, Janurary 2012.

Zoltan and I developed the datastructures and algorithm.
80\% of the implementation is my own work.
\paul{Zoltan worked on the code generator changes, but are they actually part
of the research?}
Zoltan and Peter assisted me in writing and editing the paper.

Chapter \ref{chap:threadscope} is derived from a workshop paper:

Paul Bone and Zoltan Somogyi
\newblock Profiling parallel Mercury programs with ThreadScope.
\newblock {\em 21st Workshop on Logic-based methods in Programming Environments},
Lexington KY USA, July 2011.

Zoltan provided feedback about my ideas and contributed a number of ideas of
his own.
I am the sole author of the implementation.
Zoltan assisted me in writing and editing the paper.
