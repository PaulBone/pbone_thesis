% According to gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au:

% The dissertation should be roughly 80,000 words and strictly fewer than

% Printed on a4 paper.
%
% 1.5 spaced.
%
% Margins no smaller than 30mm.
%
% Page numbers must be consecutive and printed within the margin.
%
% MSGR are flexible WRT citation style, They defer to the department on this
% (as different disciplines have different rules).  I'm waiting for Chris
% Leckie to reply to me about this.

% WARNING: citesort, hyperref and algorithm don't play nice together.
% This can be fixed by using natbib (which is apparently better) instead of
% citesort.
% And by using hyperref before algorithm.

          where indicated in the Preface,

    \item due acknowledgement has been made in the text to all other material
          used,

\chapter*{Preface}

I begun working on automatic parallelism in Mercury as part of my Honours project
for the degree of Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of Melbourne.
This work occurred before my PhD candidature commenced.
It included the profiler feedback framework that is discussed in Section
\ref{sec:background}.
It also includes an initial, rudimentary, version of the automatic
parallelisation tool
(Section \ref{sec:background}
including an algorithm for determining when a sub-computation produces or
consumes a variable (Section \ref{sec:var_use_time}).
\paul{XXX: Update this}

Peter Wang and I worked together to implement work stealing for the Mercury
runtime system.
We estimate that Peter contributed 80\% of the work stealing implementation
and that I contributed 20\%.
\paul{I haven't written up this work, I must decide which chapter it belongs
in, maybe it should be part of the background}.

Chapter \ref{chap:overlap} is derived from a journal paper:

% XXX: not really a quote, I want this text to be typeset as a paragraph whose
% indent (not just first line) is larger than normal.

\begin{quote}
Paul Bone, Zoltan Somogyi and Peter Schachte.
Estimating the overlap between dependent computations for automatic
zparallelization.
{\em Theory and Practice of Logic Programming}, 11(4--5):575--591, 2011.
\end{quote}

% Zoltan, Peter and I worked together to develop the overlap algorithm.
% \paul{The basis for this algorithm first appears in Zoltan's Leuven slides}
% The implementation and testing is all my own work.
% Zoltan and Peter assisted me in writing and editing the paper.

Chapter \ref{chap:loop_control} is derived from a conference paper:

\begin{quote}
Paul Bone, Zoltan Somogyi and Peter Schachte.
Controlling Loops in Parallel Mercury Code.
{\em Declarative Aspects and Applications of Multicore Programming},
Philadelphia PA USA, January 2012.
\end{quote}

% Zoltan and I developed the data structures and algorithm.
% 80\% of the implementation is my own work.
% \paul{Zoltan worked on the code generator changes, but are they actually part
% of the research?}
% Zoltan and Peter assisted me in writing and editing the paper.

Chapter \ref{chap:tscope} is derived from a workshop paper:

\begin{quote}
Paul Bone and Zoltan Somogyi
Profiling parallel Mercury programs with ThreadScope.
{\em 21st Workshop on Logic-based methods in Programming Environments},
Lexington KY USA, July 2011.
\end{quote}

% Zoltan provided feedback about my ideas and contributed a number of ideas of
% his own.
% I am the sole author of the implementation.
% Zoltan assisted me in writing and editing the paper.

\chapter*{Contribution to published work form}

\paul{MSGR have a form we have to include here,
I think it's one form per chapter based on published work}

especially the family I met in Philadelphia,
who where thereto take their daughter to a eye doctor for her glaucoma.

My parents, Keith and Faye Bone,
for teaching me that my vision might be an impairment but should never
be a limitation.
My brother, James Bone, for always having time to listen.
Especially when I use incomprehensible jargon,
also known as \emph{nerd words} while we where growing up.

Finally, Liz Bone my wife,
for her love, patience, understanding and caring
and being generally awesome.

\chapter{Overlap}
\label{chap:overlap}

\status{This has not been revised since the paper. I've only removed parts
of it to place elsewhere, for example, in the background section.}

\paul{
    Add discussion about how our data-flow analysis doesn't recognise loops
    since they need to be treated specially.}

\chapter{Loop Control}
\label{chap:loop_control}

\status{This has not been revised since the paper. I've only removed parts
of it to place elsewhere, for example, in the background section.}

\paul{
    Add something about updating overlap's cost model, then we need to
    re-evaluate it.}

\input{loop_control}

\chapter{Visualisation}
\label{chap:tscope}

\status{This section needs a lot more work.  But it depends on unfinished
implementation}

\chapter{Conclusion}

% Each research chapter contains a discussion of related work.
\status{No plan for this chapter yet}

I guess in this chapter I have to unify the contributions of the other
chapters.
I think that perhaps this chapter could be used to relate the contribution
of the thesis to the rest of the world, providing statements about future
work, and applicability of this work to other languages and systems.

\paul{How do you finish a thesis?}
