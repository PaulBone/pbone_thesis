\chapter*{Preface}

I begun working on automatic parallelism in Mercury as part of my Honours project
for the degree of Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of Melbourne.
This work occured before my PhD candidature commenced.
It included the profiler feedback framework that is discussed in Section
\ref{sec:background}.
It also includes an initial, rudimentary, version of the automatic
parallelisation tool
(Section \ref{sec:background}
including an algorithm for determining when a sub-computation produces or
consumes a variable (Section \ref{sec:var_use_time}).

Peter Wang and I worked together to implement work stealing for the Mercury
runtime system.
We estimate that Peter contributed 80\% of the work stealing implementation
and that I contributed 20\%.
\paul{I haven't written up this work, I must decide which chapter it belongs
in, maybe it should be part of the background}.

Chapter \ref{chap:overlap} is derived from a journal paper:

% XXX: not really a quote, I want this text to be typeset as a paragraph whose
% indent (not just first line) is larger than normal.

\begin{quote}
Paul Bone, Zoltan Somogyi and Peter Schachte.
Estimating the overlap between dependent computations for automatic
parallelization.
{\em Theory and Practice of Logic Programming}, 11(4--5):575--591, 2011.
\end{quote}

% Zoltan, Peter and I worked together to develop the overlap algorithm.
% \paul{The basis for this algorithm first appears in Zoltan's Louven slides}
% The implementation and testing is all my own work.
% Zoltan and Peter assisted me in writing and editing the paper.

Chapter \ref{chap:loop_control} is derived from a conference paper:

\begin{quote}
Paul Bone, Zoltan Somogyi and Peter Schachte.
Controlling Loops in Parallel Mercury Code.
{\em Declarative Aspects and Applications of Multicore Programming},
Philadelphia PA USA, Janurary 2012.
\end{quote}

% Zoltan and I developed the datastructures and algorithm.
% 80\% of the implementation is my own work.
% \paul{Zoltan worked on the code generator changes, but are they actually part
% of the research?}
% Zoltan and Peter assisted me in writing and editing the paper.

Chapter \ref{chap:tscope} is derived from a workshop paper:

\begin{quote}
Paul Bone and Zoltan Somogyi
Profiling parallel Mercury programs with ThreadScope.
{\em 21st Workshop on Logic-based methods in Programming Environments},
Lexington KY USA, July 2011.
\end{quote}

% Zoltan provided feedback about my ideas and contributed a number of ideas of
% his own.
% I am the sole author of the implementation.
% Zoltan assisted me in writing and editing the paper.

\chapter{Background}

\section{Parallelism in declarative languages}

\paul{
(Prolog, Mercury, Haskell,
Data-parallel languages such as DpH).
}

\paul{
This should just 'set the stage' for my work.  I would
like to leave the contrasting discussions until later in the
thesis, perhaps at the end of each major chapter.
}

\paul{
I don't want to introduce all my citations here (the way Liz has to
due to the APA-formatting standard).  Only enough that the user
understand the context for reading the research chapters.  So,
closely related work should be introduced for the first time when
it is compared with my work.

\paul{My honours thesis}

\paul{Should this section occur before profiling in Mercury, since it uses the
framework established by the deep profiler?
Or is this section a montivation for a discussion of the deep profiler?}

\chapter{Overlap}
\label{chap:overlap}

\paul{
    Add discussion about how our data-flow analysis doesn't recognize loops
    since they need to be treated specially.}

\chapter{Loop Control}
\label{chap:loop_control}

\paul{
    Add something about updating overlap's cost model, then we need to
    re-evaluate it.}
