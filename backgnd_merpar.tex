The low-level C backend of the Mercury implementation uses C as a
pesudo-assembler;
A Mercury \emph{engine} structure represents a CPU that can execute Mercury
Abstract Machine instructions.
These instructions are implemented as C macros and simply act on the
engine structure as necesary.
This engine structure has fields that represent virual registers,
some of which are mapped (using a GCC extension) to physical machine
registers - depending on the achitecture of the physical machine.
These registers include 1024 general-purpose registers including
three stack pointers for the two stacks,
and a success continuation pointer for implementing tail-calls;
the structure contains many other fields for bookkeeping,
we will discuss them as they become relevant.
More information about Mercury's execution algorithm should read
\cite{mercury_jlp}.

To make parallel execution possible Conway~\cite{conway_par} allowed
multiple instances of the engine structure to reside in memory at once.
The Operating System's threading library,
namely POSIX Threads,
is used to allow parallelism;
each thread owning a single engine.
The number of engines that a parallel Mercury program will allocate on startup
is configurable by the user,
but it defaults to the actual number of CPUs.
Users can also configure the runtime system to pin engines to CPUs
ensure there is an even distribution of engines across the machine.
% XXX: Maybe discuss how thread pinning and SMT interact.  Although all
% this thread pinning work is new work - it's not necessary part of the
% background.

Eacn POSIX Thread must maintain a pointer to its engine;
this is kept in a physical machine register as it is accessed
frequently.
In sequential code,
there was only one engine structure,
so a compiled-in constant could easily be used.
Therefore, in parallel builds there are fewer physical registers that
virtual registers may be mapped onto.

Conway~\cite{conway_par} also introduced a new structure called a
\emph{context}.
Contexts represent computations in progress.
An engine may be idle, or it may be executing a context;
a context can be running on an engine, or it may be suspended.
Each context has two stacks, a det stack and a nondet stack;
Procedures that can succeed more than once
store their frames on the nondet stack;
all other procedures use the det stack
(which behaves like a stack in an imperative language).
These stacks account for the majority of the context's memory usage.
When a context finishes execution,
its storage is put back into a pool of free contexts for
later reuse.

Following \cite{simonmar_2009_multicore_rts},
we economize on memory by using \emph{sparks}
to represent goals that have been spawned off
but whose execution has not yet been started.
\tr{
when an engine executes a spark, it uses its current context,
or if it does not have a context a new one is allocated
(from the pool of free contexts if the pool is not empty,
and a newly created context otherwise).
Unlike \cite{simonmar_2009_multicore_rts},
Mercury's sparks cannot be garbage collected and must be executed.
}

The only parallel construct in Mercury is parallel conjunction,
which is denoted $(G_1~\&~\ldots~\&~G_n)$.
All the conjuncts must be deterministic or cc\_multi,
that is, they must all have exactly one solution.
This restriction greatly simplifies the implementation,
since it guarantees that there can never be any need
to execute $(G_2~\&~\ldots~\&~G_n)$ multiple times,
just because $G_1$ has succeeded multiple times.
(Any local backtracking inside $G_1$ will not be visible to the other conjuncts;
bindings made by det code are never retracted.)
% The current Mercury implementation supports parallelism only for det code,
% since supporting it for code that may have no solution
% would represent speculative execution,
% while supporting for code that may have more than one solution
% would require significant new infrastructure for managing bindings.
However, this is not a significant limitation.
Since the design of Mercury strongly encourages deterministic code,
in our experience, about 75 to 85\% of all Mercury procedures are det,
and most programs spend an even greater fraction of their time in det code.
% \peter{Do we have any statistics regarding what proportion of execution time
%   is spent in det code?  That would be a more relevant statistic.}
Existing algorithms for executing nondeterministic code in parallel
have very significant overheads, generating slowdowns by integer factors.
Thus we have given priority to parallelizing deterministic code,
which we can do with \emph{much} lower overhead.
% We think that avoiding such slowdowns is a good idea,
% even if it does mean foregoing the parallelization of 10 to 25\% of a program.

The Mercury compiler implements $(G_1~\&~G_2~\&~\ldots~\&~G_n)$
by creating a data structure representing a barrier,
and then spawning off $(G_2~\&~\ldots~\&~G_n)$ as a spark.
\tr{
The spark is added to the head of the context's double-ended queue.
If the context finishes the execution of the first conjunct
and finds that spark is still at the head of its queue,
it will pick it up and run it itself.
This is a useful optimization,
% it's also really well-known.
since it avoids using a separate context in the relatively common case
that all the other CPUs are busy with their own work.
(Contexts contain stacks, so they occupy nontrivial amounts of memory.)
}
Since $(G_2~\&~\ldots~\&~G_n)$ is itself a conjunction,
it is handled the same way:
the context executing it
first spawns off $(G_3~\&~\ldots~\&~G_n)$ as a spark that points to the barrier
created earlier,
and then executes $G_2$ itself.
Eventually, the spawned-off remainder of the conjunction
consists only of the final conjunct, $G_n$,
and the context just executes it.
The code of each conjunct synchronizes on the barrier once it has
completed its job.
When all conjuncts have done so,
the original context will continue execution after the parallel conjunction.

\tr{
When an engine becomes idle, it will first try
to resume a suspended but runnable context if there is one.
If not, it will attempt to \emph{steal} sparks
from the tails of another context's queues.
If successful, it will allocate a context,
and start running the spark in that context.
The work-stealing dequeue structure we are using
is from \cite{Chase_2005_wsdeque}.
}

% Replaces above with a much shorter description,
% one that assumes readers know barriers
\tr{
After the end of the code of each conjunct,
the compiler inserts synchronization code.
This code starts by decrementing the number of outstanding conjuncts
in the conjunction's syncterm,
a number that was initialized to the number of conjuncts.
The engine executing the context that created the syncterm
will check whether there are any outstanding conjuncts in the conjunction.
If not, it will jump to the code after the conjunction.
If there are some,
it will suspend its context and look for other work to do.
An engine executing any other context will also check
whether there are any outstanding conjuncts when they finish.
If there are some, it will just look for other work.
If there are none, then it will first wake up the original context,
which must still be suspended.
The context it switches to executing after that
may or may not be the now runnable syncterm-creating context.
We have a special provision to avoid the potential race-condition
between one engine suspending the original context
at the same time as another engine is trying to wake it up.
}

\tr{
If an engine with a context other than the original one finds that
there are still outstanding jobs, they check their local spark queue
for any such work, otherwise they look for global work.

An engine looks for global work first by checking the local spark
queue of its context.
In some cases this check can be optimized out, for example after there
are no outstanding conjuncts in a parallel conjunction.
It will then check for runnable but suspended contexts,
If it finds a runnable context and is still holding a context from a
previous execution, it saves the old context onto the free context list.
If there are no runnable contexts,
it will then attempt to steal work from other contexts.
If unsuccessful, it will become idle and sleep for a period of time
before it looks for work again
or is woken up because a context has become runnable.

% The simplest way to implement a parallel conjunction with $n$ conjuncts
% is to spawn off $n-1$ of the conjuncts,
% letting other CPUs pick them up when they are free,
% and have the original CPU continue executing the last conjunct,
% with all conjuncts meeting at a barrier at the end,
% and only the original CPU continuing from the barrier.
% In practice, this approach has unnecessarily high overhead.
% The reason is that since current CPU chips
% have only a few cores (usually only 2-4),
% the probability is quite high that
% there will be no free CPU to pick up most of the spawned-off conjuncts,
% which means that

Mercury's mode system allows a parallel conjunct to consume variables
that are produced by conjuncts to its left, but not to its right.
This guarantees the absence of circular dependencies
and hence the absence of deadlocks between the conjuncts,
but it does allow a conjunct to depend on data that is yet to be computed
by a conjunct running in parallel.
We handle these dependencies through a source-to-source transformation
\cite{wang_dep_par_conj}.
The compiler knows which variables
are produced by one parallel conjunct and consumed by another.
For each of these shared variables,
it creates a data structure called a \emph{future} \cite{multilisp}.
When the producer has finished computing the value of the variable,
it puts the value in the future and signals its availability.
When a consumer needs the value of the variable,
it waits for this signal (if it has not yet happened),
and then retrieves the value from the future.
% Both operations are protected by mutexes.

\tr{
For each of these shared variables,
the compiler creates a data structure called a \emph{future} \cite{multilisp},
which contains room for the value of the variable,
a flag indicating whether the variable has been produced yet,
a queue of consumer contexts waiting for the value, and a mutex.
The initial value of the future has the flag set to `not yet produced'.
The signal operation on the future sets the value of the variable,
sets the flag to `produced',
and wakes up all the waiting consumers,
all under the protection of the mutex.
The wait operation on the future is also protected by the mutex:
it checks the value of the flag,
and if it says `not yet produced',
the engine will put its context on the queue and suspend it before
looking for other work.
When it wakes up,
or if the flag said that the value was already `produced',
the wait operation simply gets the value of the variable.
}

To minimize waiting,
the compiler pushes signal operations on each future
as far to the left into the producer conjunct as possible,
and it pushes wait operations
as far to the right into each of its consumer conjuncts as possible.
This means not only pushing them
into the body of the predicate called by the conjunct,
but also into the bodies of the predicates they call,
with the intention being that
each signal is put immediately after
the primitive goal that produces the value of the variable,
and each wait is put immediately before
the leftmost primitive goal that consumes the value of the variable.
Since the compiler has complete information
about which goals produce and consume which variables,
the only things that can stop the pushing process from placing the
wait immediately before the value is to be used and the signal
immediately after it is produced are
higher order calls and module boundaries:
the compiler cannot push a wait or signal operation
into code it cannot identify or cannot access.
% into the body of a predicate
% if it does not have access to the identity or to the body of the predicate.

% Work stealing --- Most things execute in sequence, parallel
% execution occurs when an engine has no work of it's own.

Given the \mapfoldl predicate in Figure~\ref{fig:mapfoldl},
this synchronization transformation
generates the code in Figure~\ref{fig:map_foldl_sync}.
