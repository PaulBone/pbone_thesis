\chapter{Conclusion}

% Each research chapter contains a discussion of related work.
\status{No plan for this chapter yet}

I guess in this chapter I have to unify the contributions of the other
chapters.
I think that perhaps this chapter could be used to relate the contribution
of the thesis to the rest of the world, providing statements about future
work, and applicability of this work to other languages and systems.

\paul{How do you finish a thesis?}
